Hello I'm Edi. This is my project for LinkPlus "Java code challenge: Bank system"

To run the program you must proceed with the following steps:
1. Open the project in the IDE of your choice 

2. Run the program in the terminal

3. After running the program you will be greated with a list of actions you can do in the terminal, press 1 to create a new account and use a unique ID for your account 

4. To transfer money create another unique account and send it to your desired account (There is a 10% fee to each transfer)


I hope you are satasfied with my work

Thank you 
Edi
